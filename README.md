# calculator
The Odin Project: Calculator

What I've learned:

Putting the parent div as relative and making the child as aboslute will have the child be positioned according to to the parent.

To make the buttons have 4 per row, we set the parent to display: grid and use grid-template-columns(4, 1fr) to make 4 columns, each taking up a same percentage

To make a button span 2 columns, do grid-colum: span 2;

Use padding for button flexibility
